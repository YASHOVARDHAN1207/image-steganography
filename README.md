# image-steganography
This project demonstrates the use of image steganography â€” the art of hiding secret information within digital images using Python. It allows users to embed and extract hidden messages within .png images by modifying the least significant bits (LSB) of pixel values, ensuring the embedded data remains imperceptible to the human eye.
